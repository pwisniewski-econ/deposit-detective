# Marketing Campaign Impact on Term Deposit Subscriptions 
## A Comparative Analysis of Causal Inference Methods

This project leverages a Marketing Dataset from a Portuguese banking institution to identify factors that influence a customer's likelihood of subscribing to term deposits. Additionally, it evaluates the impact of a marketing campaign on subscription rates. The project aims to compare traditional causal inference methods, such as Inverse Probability Weighting, with modern machine-learning-based approaches like Double Machine Learning.
