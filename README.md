# Marketing Campaign Impact on Term Deposit Subscriptions 
## A Comparative Analysis of Causal Inference Methods

This project leverages a Marketing Dataset from a Portuguese banking institution to identify when is a customer most likely to subscribe to term deposits. Additionally, it evaluates the impact of a interest rates campaign on subscription rates. The project aims to compare traditional causal inference methods with modern machine-learning-based approaches like DDML or Causal Forest.
